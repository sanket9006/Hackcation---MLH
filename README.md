**Project Description :-**
 
> Used Google Cloud for hosting Virtual machine. After that installed wordpress on that Virtuual machine. When Initially I created Virtual Machine its IP was dynamic which I made static as it was nacessary.To track Virtual Machine's performance and know other details like API Requests (per/sec), bytes received by VM, bytes send by VM. After that I designed whole webpage using wordpress. When my designing is done I decided to track user's record (data) using Google Analytics for which I created new project on Google Analytics and put 5 lines of javascript code on my webpage header section to enable google analytics. To go one step ahead (i.e to generate useful data from Google Analytics) I connected Google Analytics as source of data to Google Data studio which helps to know know users (traffic which comes to site) much better.
